## FAQ
- How does the autopause feature work?
    - It uses the watchOS pedometer to detect when you've stopped moving for a bit, or when you've started moving.
- It crashes.
    - Check to make sure you've enabled the following:
        - HealthKit read/write access
        - Apple Watch Motion & Activity access
        - Location When In Use access
