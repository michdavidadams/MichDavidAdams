Woof is a workout tracker that allows you to track your walks and playtime with your dog.

View your dog's progress towards their daily exercise goal and view their streak.

During a walk, workouts will automatically be paused when your watch detects you've stopped moving for a bit.

Woof works with HealthKit to display your workout metrics and save your workouts.
